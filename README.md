## Description
Welcome to OnlyFlags, an innovative new dating app that allows users to share the best, the worst, and the most questionable aspects of themselves in the hopes of finding true love.

OnlyFlags leverages three main data points to help users find a match:

    - Green Flag: Users put their best foot forward with one of their finest personal qualities
	
    - Yellow Flag: Users share something polarizing about themselves. Is a hotdog a sandwich? Was that weird internet dress yellow or blue? Yellow flags can be a real time saver in deciphering where someone stand on today's most controversial habits and opinions.

    - Red Flag: If only you had known Mr. Wonderful voted for Dukakis in '88, or that your new fling collects paintings by John Wayne Gacey. Red Flags save users the frustration and heartache of discovering a person's worst qualities before it's too late.

OnlyFlags utilizes a familiar interface that allows users to easily select or dismiss potential matches, while our three data point matching approach lets OnlyFlags stand out in the saturated dating app market and assures users make quality matches faster.
